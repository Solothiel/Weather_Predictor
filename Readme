I have toyed around with the Idea of displaying the city and id in the database, but I couldn't get to work.
Def get_city_name(latitude, longitude, api_key)


The Project is wanting to get 5-year historical data for a location.

Needing to retrieve data from the link above and then calculate the data groupings for the location.
    Average, minimum and maximum temperature.   (used Fahrenheit)
    Average, minimum and maximum wind speed. (used miles per hour)
    Total, minimum and maximum precipitation (in inches)

The information gathered is stored in SQLite database using SQLAlchemy Object-Relational Mapping.

Built error responses if the information was not found.

This is what the input will look like
Enter location and date to fetch 5-year historical weather data.
Enter latitude: 43.46
Enter longitude: -112.04
Enter number for the month: 06
Enter number for the day: 15
Enter 4 digit number for year: 2024
